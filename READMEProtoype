The goal of the protoype was to create a simple game of roll a ball but take it up a notch with some knoweldge in game design to add something else that interacts with the mechanics of the game to create an element. In this case I used a timer that forces players to utlizie the best path in the game and develop skill to win the game by collecting 15 pickups.
